I made this because I found another repository that barely worked, and its code was awful (not like mine is any better)


# usage
```
[-h] [--purge] [--download-images DOWNLOAD_IMAGES] [--debug]

options:
  -h, --help            show this help message and exit
  --purge, -p           Purge all images
  --download-images DOWNLOAD_IMAGES, -d DOWNLOAD_IMAGES
                        Download images for count.
  --debug               Enable some annoying debug messages.```
